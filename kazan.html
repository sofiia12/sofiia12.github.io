								Kazan is the capital of the Republic of Tatarstan, an ancient city with a long history, located on the left bank of the Volga River.
								Kazan is one of the striking examples of how people of different nationalities and religions live peacefully in one city, in an atmosphere of friendliness and tolerance.
